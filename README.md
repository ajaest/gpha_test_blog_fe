geographica-blog frontend
================

This is a functional and not very fancy frontend for the 
[geographica-blog backend](https://github.com/ajaest/gpha_test_blog_be). 
For the sake of velocity, it was created forking the frontend part from a
old project I did myself([see here](https://github.com/ajaest/django_simple_task)), so
it uses pretty old libraries (like Angular 1.3.x, Bootstrap 3.3.5 or 3.9.0). 

To put it running please run in a terminal the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp
```

Then you can open the app in your browser visiting [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

Take into account that in order to have the app working currently, you
must have an instance of the [backend repo](https://github.com/ajaest/gpha_test_blog_be)
running.
